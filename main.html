			What is Wrong With the Klein Bottle
		</h1>
		<p>
			As I have described in my <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGEL5QnpfWiTGxTjdWyk9eza1j8jFEOKazra4UoOxgY/edit?usp=sharing">paper</a>, the Klein Bottle has a distinction between itself and the Klein surface (that which is usually described by the ant on the surface analogy). In this site, I wish to show with animations what it is that I mean.

			Further Explanation of How Rotation Causes Flattening

		<p>
			As can be seen with this animation, as the simple two dimensional square rotates in the higher third dimension. It's two dimensional projection flattens to a line. Furthermore, as it rotates, one side grows and the other shrinks as they grow further or closer to the viewer. It is this which will cause the flattening in a Klein Bottle as well.
