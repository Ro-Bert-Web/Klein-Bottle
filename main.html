			What is Wrong With the Klein Bottle
		</h1>
		<p>
			As I have described in my <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGEL5QnpfWiTGxTjdWyk9eza1j8jFEOKazra4UoOxgY/edit?usp=sharing">paper</a>, the Klein Bottle has a distinction between itself and the Klein surface (that which is usually described by the ant on the surface analogy). In this site, I wish to show with animations what it is that I mean.

			Further Explanation of How Rotation Causes Flattening

		<p>
			As can be seen with this animation, as the simple two dimensional square rotates in the higher third dimension. It's two dimensional projection flattens to a line. Furthermore, as it rotates, one side grows and the other shrinks as they grow further or closer to the viewer. It is this which will cause the flattening in a Klein Bottle as well.

		<p>
			What can be seen here is a fourth dimensional equivalent of a cube. The hypercube can be aqcuired by extruding a cube into the fourth dimension. Because it is in four dimensions, we can rotate two axis together twice to get the dual rotation as shown above.

			A Look at the Klein Bottle

		<p>
			Though this is not the usual rendering of a Klein Bottle, it is a Klein Bottle. This was achieved by rotating a square cross section around the centeral point. This gives us a three dimensional extrusion that is a torus. But if we were to rotate one axis with the fourth dimension as we did so, we'd get the twist shown at the kink which provides us with a Klein Bottle. In this case, the Y axis (vertical) is rotate with the W axis (fourth) and the X and Z are rotated to make the loop. If you were to follow the sides around, the top and bottom would swap because they are rotated with the fourth dimension while left and right stay left and right. This shows a sense of flipping that will be explained later.

			Defining Sides
		</h1>
		<iframe src = "https://ro-bert-web.github.io/Klein-Bottle/Hypercube-Edge-Animation.html" style = "width:100%;height:500px;"></iframe>
		<p>
			When we describe the Klein Bottle as one sided, that must be defined. It does have one side, but in the fourth dimensional sense it does not have no edge. To show what an edge is in the fourth dimension, this animation carries a hypercube that has been flattened. It is now a cube in 4-space with an edge around it. This is the same as if you had a cube and flattened it. Now you have a paper with an edge. A flatlander does not see that edge as an edge but instead a face. So when we say our four dimensiona shapes are one sided and there is no edge, it is because we see the edges as our faces.

			Showing the Klein Bottle's Edge
		</h1>
		<iframe src = "https://ro-bert-web.github.io/Klein-Bottle/Klein-Bottle-Animation-Sides.html" style = "width:100%;height:500px;"></iframe>
		<p>
			This Klein Bottle now has fourth dimensional depth to show its edge and face. At the start, the square is one side and the octagon is the other side. The connection between them (invisible in this sense only so that it does not clutter up the screen with lines) is the edge (the small gap between corresponding squares and octagons would be an edge). As they rotate around the Klein Bottle, they swap places. This means the two sides connect again and it has only one side. Just like in the case of the mobius loop.

			Finally, a Journey Through a Klein Bottle
		</h1>
		<iframe src = "https://ro-bert-web.github.io/Klein-Bottle/Klein-Bottle-Path.html" style = "width:100%;height:500px;"></iframe>
		<p>
			To view this animation, first click on the animation, then use the following controls: F = travel through the Klein Bottle, SPACE = shift projection from perspective to isometric.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you go around in perspective view, you grow and shrink as you raise and lower in the fourth dimension. When you get to the bottle neck, you begin to flatten. If you notice, if you look at your points, they will be going forward, up, and some other direction. If you go around the loop, the left or right point (inside or outside if it is easier), will be swapped but no others will be. This is because you've flipped in the fourth dimension. This is what a journey along a Klein Bottle is like. And notice that at no point to you make it to the "outside" of the hallway.
		</p>
		<h1>
			An In-Depth Explanation
		</h1>
		<p>
			Looking back to the previous animation, the object goes around the hyper rotation and comes out on the other fourth dimensional side while also being reversed in three dimensional space. But to show what is going on, the actual mechanics must be explained so that you can see what is going on and also that what is going on is sound. First off, there are the normal three dimensional rotations around the curve until it has been set up to rotate in four dimensions. This rotation is achieved by the matrix multiplication.

			1	0	0	0
			0	1	0	0
			0	0	cos(PI)	-sin(PI)
			0	0	sin(PI)	cos(PI)

around the center of the curve. For this reason, it can be seen that it is indeed a rotation between the Z and W axis. This shape is a Klein Bottle constructed by twisting a torus before you connect it. And the behavior is exactly calculated to show exactly what would happen if you walked around it. And notice yet again, you never made it to the outside of the hallway, showing that the Klein Bottle's sidedness is not in three dimensions but in four dimensions.

			Conclusion
		</h1>
		<p>
			In this site I have shown exactly what a fourth dimensional Klein Bottle is. But the normal description of an ant on its surface is not an imaginary shape. It is instead what should be called a Klein Surface. The two are different. The Klein Bottle is as I have shown it and the Klein Bottle is as the ant shows it. The bottle is a shape that - though flat in the sense of a hyperbeing - is very fourth dimensional. But the surface is just a three dimensional shape which bridges itself in the fourth dimension.
