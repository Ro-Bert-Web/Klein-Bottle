			What is Wrong With the Klein Bottle
		</h1>
		<p>
			As I have described in my <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGEL5QnpfWiTGxTjdWyk9eza1j8jFEOKazra4UoOxgY/edit?usp=sharing">paper</a>, the Klein Bottle has a distinction between itself and the Klein surface (that which is usually described by the ant on the surface analogy). In this site, I wish to show with animations what it is that I mean.

			Further Explanation of How Rotation Causes Flattening

		<p>
			As can be seen with this animation, as the simple two dimensional square rotates in the higher third dimension. It's two dimensional projection flattens to a line. Furthermore, as it rotates, one side grows and the other shrinks as they grow further or closer to the viewer. It is this which will cause the flattening in a Klein Bottle as well.

			An Introduction to the Hypercube and Four Dimensions

		<p>
			What can be seen here is a fourth dimensional equivalent of a cube. The hypercube can be aqcuired by extruding a cube into the fourth dimension. Because it is in four dimensions, we can rotate two axis together twice to get the dual rotation as shown above.

			A Look at the Klein Bottle

		<p>
			Though this is not the usual rendering of a Klein Bottle, it is a Klein Bottle. This was achieved by rotating a square cross section around the centeral point. This gives us a three dimensional extrusion that is a torus. But if we were to rotate one axis with the fourth dimension as we did so, we'd get the twist shown at the kink which provides us with a Klein Bottle. In this case, the Y axis (vertical) is rotate with the W axis (fourth) and the X and Z are rotated to make the loop. If you were to follow the sides around, the top and bottom would swap because they are rotated with the fourth dimension while left and right stay left and right. This shows a sense of flipping that will be explained later.
