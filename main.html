			What is Wrong With the Klein Bottle
		</h1>
		<p>
			As I have described in my <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGEL5QnpfWiTGxTjdWyk9eza1j8jFEOKazra4UoOxgY/edit?usp=sharing">paper</a>, the Klein Bottle has a distinction between itself and the Klein surface (that which is usually described by the ant on the surface analogy). In this site, I wish to show with animations what it is that I mean.

			Further Explanation of How Rotation Causes Flattening

		<p>
			As can be seen with this animation, as the simple two dimensional square rotates in the higher third dimension. It's two dimensional projection flattens to a line. Furthermore, as it rotates, one side grows and the other shrinks as they grow further or closer to the viewer. It is this which will cause the flattening in a Klein Bottle as well.

			An Introduction to the Hypercube and Four Dimensions

		<p>
			What can be seen here is a fourth dimensional equivalent of a cube. The hypercube can be aqcuired by extruding a cube into the fourth dimension. Because it is in four dimensions, we can rotate two axis together twice to get the dual rotation as shown above.

			A Look at the Klein Bottle

		<p>
			Though this is not the usual rendering of a Klein Bottle, it is a Klein Bottle. This was achieved by rotating a square cross section around the centeral point. This gives us a three dimensional extrusion that is a torus. But if we were to rotate one axis with the fourth dimension as we did so, we'd get the twist shown at the kink which provides us with a Klein Bottle. In this case, the Y axis (vertical) is rotate with the W axis (fourth) and the X and Z are rotated to make the loop. If you were to follow the sides around, the top and bottom would swap because they are rotated with the fourth dimension while left and right stay left and right. This shows a sense of flipping that will be explained later.

			Defining Sides
		</h1>

		<p>
			When we describe the Klein Bottle as one sided, that must be difined. It does have one side, but in the fourth dimensional sense it does not have no edge. To show what an edge is in the fourth dimension, this animation carries a hypercube that has been flattened. It is now a cube in 4-space with an edge around it. This is the same as if you had a cube and flattened it. Now you have a paper with an edge. A flatlander does not see that edge as an edge but instead a face. So when we say our four dimensiona shapes are one sided and there is no edge, it is because we see the edges as our faces.

			Showing the Klein Bottle's Edge
		</h1>
		<iframe src = "https://ro-bert-web.github.io/Klein-Bottle/Klein-Bottle-Animation-Edge.html" style = "width:100%;height:500px;"></iframe>
		<p>
			This Klein Bottle now has fourth dimensional depth to show its edge and face. At the start, the square is one side and the octagon is the other side. The connection between them (invisible in this sense only so that it does not clutter up the screen with lines) is the edge (the small gap between corresponding squares and octagons would be an edge). As they rotate around the Klein Bottle, they swap places. This means the two sides connect again and it has only one side. Just like in the case of the mobius loop.
